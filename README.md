## Howdy 👍 

Some things you're good at. Some things are good for you. For me, programming is both.

That's why I love programming and why I always seek to provide value with it.

It's why I love Go, Test-Driven Development, and Agile/Scrum. They are all tools that help me provide value to my team and help the software we write provide value to users.

After years of searching, I realized [programming is my ikigai](https://dev.to/cpustejovsky/a-month-of-development-work-52gh) (learn more about ikigai [here](https://www.forbes.com/sites/chrismyers/2018/02/23/how-to-find-your-ikigai-and-transform-your-outlook-on-life-and-business/#3b81b4532ed4)).
