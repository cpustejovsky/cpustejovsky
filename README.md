After years of searching, I realized [programming is my ikigai](https://dev.to/cpustejovsky/a-month-of-development-work-52gh) (learn more about ikigai [here](https://www.forbes.com/sites/chrismyers/2018/02/23/how-to-find-your-ikigai-and-transform-your-outlook-on-life-and-business/#3b81b4532ed4)). Since then I've been learning and growing as a developer.
