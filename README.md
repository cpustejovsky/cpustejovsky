After years of searching, I realized [programming is my ikigai](https://dev.to/cpustejovsky/a-month-of-development-work-52gh) (learn more about ikigai [here](https://www.forbes.com/sites/chrismyers/2018/02/23/how-to-find-your-ikigai-and-transform-your-outlook-on-life-and-business/#3b81b4532ed4)). Since then I've been learning and growing as a developer. 
- 🔭 **I’m currently working on** Rebuilding [Estuary](https://github.com/cpustejovsky/estuary)'s front-end in TypeScript, back-end in Go.
- 🌱 **I’m currently learning** Go.
- 💬 **Ask me about** JavaScript, Golang, cryptocurrency, classics, philosophy, or just about anything.
