Since then I've been learning and growing as a developer. 

- 🔭 **I’m currently working at** DecisionIQ as a Front-End developer
- 🌱 **I’m currently learning** TypeScript, Django, PostgreSQL, and Go.
- 💬 **Ask me about** JavaScript, cryptocurrency, classics, philosophy, or just about anything.
- 📫 **How to reach me:** [charles@cpustejovsky.com](mailto:charles@cpustejovsky.com) (to ask about stuff mentioned above or for any other reason).
- ⚡ **Fun fact:** The very first animal I held was a snake (is it any wonder I like Python?).
