## Howdy 👍 

There are things you're good at and things that are good for you. Programming is both for me.

That's why I love programming and why I am always seeking to provide more value with it.

It's why I love Go, Test-Driven Development, and Agile/Scrum. I believe they are all tools that better help me provide value to my team and my company and help my company provide value to their users.

After years of searching, I realized [programming is my ikigai](https://dev.to/cpustejovsky/a-month-of-development-work-52gh) (learn more about ikigai [here](https://www.forbes.com/sites/chrismyers/2018/02/23/how-to-find-your-ikigai-and-transform-your-outlook-on-life-and-business/#3b81b4532ed4)).
