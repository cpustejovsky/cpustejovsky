## About
I'm Charles Pustejovsky. I'm a software developer with high functioning autism. My non-technical special interests are in religion, philosophy, politics.

This README is for anyone to better understand how to interact with me.
## Getting Started (Communication)
**tl;dr assume ignorance, not maliciousness.**
### General
If I say something offensive or rude to you, let me know. Assume it is a mistake, because it so often is. Social nuances have been hard for me so I've often missed crucial details.

### Asking Questions
Expect honest and direct answers. If I upset you, please tell me why. I will keep it in mind and improve in the future.
### Answering Questions
I view every question I ask as a favor. It is some level of emotional labor.

If I asked you to review some code for me or help me move, I expect "no"s and "not right now"s.

You are under no obligation to entertain my questions. You are not entitled to give anyone you labor for free.
### Conversations
If I veer into my special interests, please let me know if you:
* are not interested in hearing more
* do not understand what I'm talking about.

I understand the world via my special interests so will often try to explain things using them. But if the references aren't working then I'm not explaining myself well. If that's the case, I should change how I communicate.
